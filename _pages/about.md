<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an <b>Associate Professor in Software Engineering</b> at <b>Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)</b>. My research focuses on <b>software architecture, software maintenance and evolution, and their interplay with artificial intelligence (e.g., large language models)</b>. I have published around 20 papers in leading international venues such as <b>TSE, JSS, IST, and ICSE</b>, and I was honored with an <b>ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award 🏆</b>.

Before joining NJUST, I completed my Ph.D. at <b>Nanjing University</b> under the supervision of <a href="https://softeng.nju.edu.cn/faculty/HeZhang/index.html">Prof. He (Jason) Zhang</a>. I also spent time as a visiting researcher at <b>Groningen University</b>, founded by the <b>China Scholarship Council (CSC)</b>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/">Prof. Paris Avgeriou</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=b4SXLNEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Daniel Feitosa (Groningen University)</a>. 

I actively collaborate with internal scholars, including <a href="https://malibabar.wordpress.com/">Prof. Muhammad Ali Babar (The University of Adelaide)</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~yc349/">Prof. Yuanfang Cai (Drexel University)</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=E86VWYEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Shanshan Li (Nanjing University)</a>.

# 💡 Opportunities

I am always excited to work with <b>motivated students</b> who share a passion for software engineering and computer science. If you are <b>curious, creative, and eager to push boundaries</b>, my group offers an open and supportive environment to grow.

🚀 Join me—and let’s explore the future of software together!
